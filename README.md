# seater

Run the project by creating a Django run configuration.


## Notes about Django
- One project can run multiple apps.
- `seater` is the project: it contains the settings of the project (e.g.`settings.py`, `urls.py`).
- `seating` is our app: it contains all the code needed to create and display seating arrangements.

## PyCharm tips
- Use the built-in terminal when using the command line of this project, it will automatically run commands in the virtual environment.
- Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>L</kbd> to reformat the code according to PEP8, so that all code looks the same.
